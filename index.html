      <p class="under"><b>Here's a brief overview of Robinson's life:</b></p>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1791 - </strong>Born into a builder family in England.</li>
        <li><strong>1824 - </strong>Emigrated to the Australian colonies to set up as a builder.</li>
        <li><strong>(~1825 ~ 1832) - </strong>Conflict between the Tasmanian Aboriginals and British colonists grew into conflicts named the Black War.</li>
        <li><strong>(~1829) - </strong>Robinson was brought in as a conciliator between settlers and Aborigines.</li>
        <li><b>1835 - </b>With promises of food and peace, Robinson had convinced most Aboriginals to relocate to a camp on Flinders Island. The goal was to "civilize" the natives.</li>
        <li>Many residents of Flinders died of European dieseases and the stresses of homesickness. Soon after, Robinson left the settlement.</li>
        <li><b>1839 - </b>Robinson was appointed the Chief Protector of Aborigines, managing the Protectorate of Port Phillip and was paid a total of £8000 for his role. The small community included a church, to aid with civilizing.</li>
        <li>The Protectorate was abolished on 31 December 1849 and in 1852 he returned to Europe.</li>
        <li><b>1866 - </b>Robinson died in Bath, England.</li>
